50,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.
51,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Surely God would not have created such a being as man, with an ability to grasp the infinite, to exist only for a day! No, no, man was made for immortality."

53,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"I have never studied the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war.

55,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong.

In the present civil war it is quite possible that God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party – and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose."

60,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable – a most sacred right – a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world."
61,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved – I do not expect the house to fall – but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.
62,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it."
63,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"I desire to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside of me."

66,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization.
67,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser – in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business enough."
68,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?"
69,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"The love of property and consciousness of right and wrong have conflicting places in our organization, which often makes a man’s course seem crooked, his conduct a riddle."
70,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Elections belong to the people. It’s their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blisters."
71,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"When I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That’s my religion."
72,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."
73,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"Property is the fruit of labor…property is desirable…is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built."
74,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,I can make a General in five minutes but a good horse is hard to replace.
75,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"My father taught me to work, but not to love it. I never did like to work, and I don’t deny it. I’d rather read, tell stories, crack jokes, talk, laugh — anything but work."
76,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
77,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and if we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the loss."
78,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me.
79,Abraham Lincoln Quotes,"I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a bad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can have. The fact is truth is your truest friend, no matter what the circumstances are."

I classify them using one criterion: their virtue."
21,Alexander The Great Quotes,"In the end, when it’s over, all that matters is what you’ve done."

32,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,I knew I was a winner back in the late sixties. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way. I hope it never will.
33,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"Learned helplessness is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn’t matter."

39,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"You must have a sincere and burning desire to achieve what you dream, dedicate yourself to making progress, and take control of your circumstances to change your body."
40,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow. This area of pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion. That’s what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they’ll go through the pain no matter what happens."
41,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body.
42,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character.
43,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,I’m addicted to exercising and I have to do something every day.
44,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn’t think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know.
45,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength."
46,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"Just like in bodybuilding, failure is also a necessary experience for growth in our own lives, for if we’re never tested to our limits, how will we know how strong we really are? How will we ever grow?"
47,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,"You have to build the ultimate physical machine, but also the ultimate mind."
48,Arnold Schwarzenegger Quotes,What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing.

2,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Living is like tearing through a museum. Not until later do you really start absorbing what you saw, thinking about it, looking it up in a book, and remembering – because you can’t take it in all at once."

7,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Not to live for the day, that would be materialistic – but to treasure the day. I realize that most of us live on the skin – on the surface – without appreciating just how wonderful it is simply to be alive at all."
8,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I believe, every day, you should have at least one exquisite moment."
9,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Life is a party. Dress for it.

40,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"The beauty in a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair. The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart; the place where love resides. True beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It’s the caring and that she lovingly gives the passion that she shows and the beauty of a woman only grows with passing years."
41,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Elegance is the only beauty that never fades. A woman can be beautiful as well as intellectual.

Others matter more than you do, so ‘don’t fuss, dear; get on with it.’"
42,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Sex appeal is something that you feel deep down inside. It’s suggested rather than shown. I’m not as well-stacked as Sophia Loren or Gina Lollobrigida, but there is more to sex appeal than just measurements. I don’t need a bedroom to prove my womanliness. I can convey just as much sex appeal, picking apples off a tree or standing in the rain."
43,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides."
44,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Look, whenever I hear or read I’m beautiful, I simply don’t understand it … I’m certainly not beautiful in any conventional way. I didn’t make my career on beauty."
45,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole, but true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives, the passion that she knows."
46,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Make-up can only make you look pretty on the outside but it doesn’t help if you’re ugly on the inside. Unless you eat the make-up.
47,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"And the beauty of a woman, with passing years only grows!"

49,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I’m not beautiful. My mother once called me an ugly duckling. But, listed separately, I have a few good features."
50,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,There are more important things than outward appearance. No amount of makeup can cover an ugly personality.
51,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Dress like you are already famous.
52,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution-peace.
53,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Since the world has existed, there has been injustice. But it is one world, the more so as it becomes smaller, more accessible. There is just no question that there is more obligation that those who have should give to those who have nothing."
54,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"The ‘Third World’ is a term I don’t like very much, because we’re all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering."
55,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I can testify to what UNICEF means to children, because I was among those who received food and medical relief right after World War II. I have a long-lasting gratitude and trust for what UNICEF does."
56,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"It makes me self-conscious. It’s because I’m known, in the limelight, that it’s getting all the gravy, but if you knew, if you saw some of the people who make it possible for UNICEF to help these children survive. These are the people who do the jobs-the unknowns, whose names you will never know…I at least get a dollar a year, but they don’t."
57,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Taking care of children has nothing to do with politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicization of humanitarian aid, there will be a humanization of politics."
58,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"People in these places don’t know Audrey Hepburn, but they recognize the name UNICEF. When they see UNICEF their faces light up, because they know that something is happening. In the Sudan, for example, they call a water pump UNICEF."
59,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"A quality education has the power to transform societies in a single generation, provide children with the protection they need from the hazards of poverty, labor exploitation and disease, and given them the knowledge, skills, and confidence to reach their full potential."
60,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Water is life, and clean water means health."
61,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"My first big mission for UNICEF in Ethiopia was just to attract attention, before it was too late, to conditions which threatened the whole country. My role was to inform the world, to make sure that the people of Ethiopia were not forgotten."
62,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Some people dream of having a big swimming pool. With me, it’s closets."
63,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"If I’m honest, I have to tell you I still read fairy tales and I like them best of all."
64,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I’m an introvert… I love being by myself, love being outdoors, love taking a long walk with my dogs and looking at the trees, flowers, the sky."
65,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,You can always tell what kind of a person a man really thinks you are by the earrings he gives you.
66,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Paris is always a good idea.
67,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Everything I learned I learned from the movies.

71,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,I never think of myself as an icon. What is in other people’s minds is not in my mind. I just do my thing.
72,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"There must be something wrong with those people who think Audrey Hepburn doesn’t perspire, hiccup or sneeze, because they know that’s not true. In fact, I hiccup more than most."
73,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"In Holland and Belgium, and afterwards in England, my happiest moments were in the country. I’ve always had a passion for the outdoors, for trees, for birds and flowers."
74,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"If my world were to cave in tomorrow, I would look back on all the pleasures, excitements and worthwhilenesses I have been lucky enough to have had. Not the sadness, not my miscarriages or my father leaving home, but the joy of everything else. It will have been enough."
75,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,I never thought I’d land in pictures with a face like mine.
76,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I was asked to act when I couldn’t act. I was asked to sing ‘Funny Face’ when I couldn’t sing, and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn’t dance – and do all kinds of things I wasn’t prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it."
77,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I’m not a born actress, as such, I care about expressing feelings."
78,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"People associate me with a time when movies were pleasant, when women wore pretty dresses in films and you heard beautiful music. I always love it when people write me and and say ‘I was having a rotten time, and I walked into a cinema and saw one of your movies, and it made such a difference.’"
79,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"[I have] enormous faith, but it’s not attached to any one in particular religion. My mother was one thing, my father another. In Holland they were all Calvinists. That has no importance at all to me."
80,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I was born with something that appealed to an audience at that particular time…I acted instinctively. I’ve had one of the greatest schools of all – a whole row of great, great directors."
81,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I’m half-Irish, half-Dutch, and I was born in Belgium. If I was a dog, I’d be in a hell of a mess!"
82,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Actually, you have to be a little bit in love with your leading man and vice versa. If you’re going to portray love, you have to feel it. You can’t do it any other way. But you don’t carry it beyond the set."
83,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"I had to make a choice at one point in my life, of missing films or missing my children. It was a very easy decision to make because I missed my children so very much."
84,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"She did the best that we could be; she was perfectly charming and perfectly loving. She was a dream. And she was the kind of dream that you remember when you wake up smiling. In a cruel and imperfect world, she was living proof that God could still create perfection.Richard Dreyfuss"
85,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"In a cruel and imperfect world, she was living proof that God could still create perfection.Rex Reed"
86,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Audrey was the kind of person who when she saw someone else suffering tried to take their pain on herself. She was a healer. She knew how to love. You didn’t have to be in constant contact with her to feel you had a friend. We always picked up right where we left off.Shirley Maclaine
87,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"Audrey had an angelic quality about her. She didn’t act like she was better than everyone, she just had a presence, an energy, a sort of light coming from within her that was overwhelming.Kevyn Aucoin"
88,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,"The extraordinary mystique of hers made you think she lived on rose petals and listened to nothing but Mozart, but it wasn’t true. She was quite funny and ribald. She could tell a dirty joke. She played charades with a great sense of fun and vulgarity, and she could be quite bitchy.André Previn"
89,Audrey Hepburn Quotes,Audrey gave more than she ever got. The whole world is going to miss her.Steven Spielberg

0,Ayn Rand Quotes,"Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a person’s sexual choice is the result and sum of their fundamental convictions. Tell me what a person finds sexually attractive and I will tell you their entire philosophy of life."

18,Ayn Rand Quotes,The worst guilt is to accept an unearned guilt.
19,Ayn Rand Quotes,"Why do they always teach us that it’s easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves? It’s the hardest thing in the world–to do what we want. And it takes the greatest kind of courage. I mean, what we really want."
20,Ayn Rand Quotes,Power-lust is a weed that grows only in the vacant lots of an abandoned mind.
21,Ayn Rand Quotes,"The great creators — the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors — stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won."
22,Ayn Rand Quotes,One loses everything when one loses one’s sense of humor.
23,Ayn Rand Quotes,Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot be conquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone.

26,Ayn Rand Quotes,"Love should be treated like a business deal, but every business deal has its own terms and its own currency. And in love, the currency is virtue. You love people not for what you do for them or what they do for you. You love them for the values, the virtues, which they have achieved in their own character."
27,Ayn Rand Quotes,The most depraved type of human being is the man without a purpose.

33,Ayn Rand Quotes,She did not know the nature of her loneliness. The only words that named it were: This is not the world I expected.
34,Ayn Rand Quotes,"When I disagree with a rational man, I let reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit."

46,Ayn Rand Quotes,Never ask people about your work.

55,Ayn Rand Quotes,To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That’s what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul – would you understand why that’s much harder?

59,Ayn Rand Quotes,"There’s nothing as significant as a human face. Nor as eloquent. We can never really know another person, except by our first glance at him. Because, in that glance, we know everything. Even though we’re not always wise enough to unravel the knowledge."

21,Benjamin Franklin Quotes,Don’t misinform your Doctor nor your Lawyer.
22,Benjamin Franklin Quotes,"To expect people to be good, to be just, to be temperate, etc., without showing them how they should become so, seems like the ineffectual charity mentioned by the apostle, which consisted in saying to the hungry, the cold and the naked, be ye fed, be ye warmed, be ye clothed, without showing them how they should get food, fire or clothing."

29,Benjamin Franklin Quotes,"When I am employed in serving others, I do not look upon myself as conferring favors, but as paying debts. I have received much kindness from men to whom I shall never have an opportunity of making the least direct returns; and numberless mercies from God, who is infinitely above being benefited by our services. Those kindnesses from men I can, therefore, only return on their fellow-men, and I can only show my gratitude for those mercies from God by a readiness to help His other children."

34,Benjamin Franklin Quotes,"Having been poor is no shame, being ashamed of it is."
35,Benjamin Franklin Quotes,"If a sound body and a sound mind, which is as much as to say health and virtue, are to be preferred before all other considerations, ought not men, in choosing a business either for themselves or children, to refuse such as are unwholesome for the body, and such as make a man too dependent, too much obliged to please others, and too much subjected to their humors in order to be recommended and get a livelihood?"

37,Bob Marley Quotes,"He’s not perfect. You aren’t either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isn’t going to quote poetry, he’s not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Don’t hurt him, don’t change him, and don’t expect for more than he can give. Don’t analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when he’s not there.

44,Bob Marley Quotes,"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colors seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life."

50,Bob Marley Quotes,There will never be no love at all.
51,Bob Marley Quotes,"You say you love rain, but you use an umbrella to walk under it. You say you love sun, but you seek shelter when it is shining. You say you love wind, but when it comes you close your windows. So that’s why I’m scared when you say you love me."

75,Bob Marley Quotes,"Life and Jah are one in the same. Jah is the gift of existence. I am in some way eternal, I will never be duplicated. The singularity of every man and woman is Jah’s gift. What we struggle to make of it is our sole gift to Jah. The process of what that struggle becomes, in time, the Truth."
76,Bob Marley Quotes,"Me don’t dip on nobody’s side. Me don’t dip on the black man’s side, not the white man’s side. Me dip on God’s side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white."
77,Bob Marley Quotes,"People want to listen to a message, word from Jah. This could be passed through me or anybody. I am not a leader. Messenger. The words of the songs, not the person, is what attracts people."

41,Helen Keller Quotes,"I am not a perfect being. . . . I have more faults than I know what to do with. I have a naughty temper. I am stubborn, impatient of hindrances and of stupidity.

I do not feel that I have been compensated for the two senses I lack. I have worked hard for all the senses I have got, and always I beg for more."

82,Helen Keller Quotes,"When we complain of having to do the same thing over and over, let us remember that God does not send new trees, strange flowers and different grasses every year.

Even so would the same tasks which fill our daily lives put on new meanings if we wrought them in the spirit of renewal from within–a spirit of growth and beauty."

4,John Lennon Quotes,"There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."

34,John Lennon Quotes,"Produce your own dream. If you want to save Peru, go save Peru. It’s quite possible to do anything, but not if you put it on the leaders and the parking meters.

54,John Lennon Quotes,"…Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I don’t know what will go first, rock ‘n’ roll or Christianity. We’re more popular than Jesus now. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It’s them twisting it that ruins it for me."
55,John Lennon Quotes,"When I cannot sing my heart, I can only speak my mind."
56,John Lennon Quotes,"Sometimes you wonder, I mean really wonder. I know we make our own reality, and we always have a choice, but how much is preordained? Is there always a fork in the road, and are there two preordained paths that are equally preordained? There could be hundreds of paths where one could go this way or that way — there’s a chance, and it’s very strange sometimes."
57,John Lennon Quotes,"Peace is not something you wish for; It’s something you make, something you do, something you are, and something you give away."

66,John Lennon Quotes,"I believe Jesus was right, Buddha was right, and all of those people like that are right. They’re all saying the same thing — and I believe it. I believe what Jesus actually said — the basic things he laid down about love and goodness — and not what people say he said."
67,John Lennon Quotes,All music is rehash. There are only a few notes. Just variations on a theme. Try to tell the kids in the Seventies who were screaming to the Bee Gees that their music was just The Beatles redone. There is nothing wrong with the Bee Gees.

3,Johnny Cash Quotes,"That was the big thing when I was growing up, singing on the radio. The extent of my dream was to sing on the radio station in Memphis. Even when I got out of the Air Force in 1954, I came right back to Memphis and started knocking on doors at the radio station."
4,Johnny Cash Quotes,"My father was a man of love. He always loved me to death. He worked hard in the fields, but my father never hit me. Never. I don’t ever remember a really cross, unkind word from my father."
5,Johnny Cash Quotes,"This business I’m in is different. It’s special. The people around me feel like brothers and sisters. We hardly know each other, but we’re that close; somehow there’s been an immediate bonding between total strangers. We share each other’s triumphs, and when one of us gets hurt, we all bleed – it’s corny, I know, but it’s true. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. It’s great. It turns up the heat in life."

7,Johnny Cash Quotes,"You’ve got a song you’re singing from your gut, you want that audience to feel it in their gut. And you’ve got to make them think that you’re one of them sitting out there with them too. They’ve got to be able to relate to what you’re doing."

12,Johnny Cash Quotes,"It’s like a novelist writing far out things. If it makes a point and makes sense, then people like to read that. But if it’s off in left field and goes over the edge, you lose it. The same with musical talent, I think."
13,Johnny Cash Quotes,"The things that have always been important: to be a good man, to try to live my life the way God would have me, to turn it over to Him that His will might be worked in my life, to do my work without looking back, to give it all I’ve got, and to take pride in my work as an honest performer."

26,Johnny Cash Quotes,I’m not bitter. Why should I be bitter? I’m thrilled to death with life.
27,Johnny Cash Quotes,"I love weather. I’m a connoisseur of weather. Wherever my travels take me, the first thing I do is turn on the weather channel and see what’s going on, what’s coming. I like to know about regional weather patterns, how storms are created in different altitudes, what kinds of clouds are forming or dissipating or blowing through, where the winds are coming from, where they’ve been. That’s not a passion everybody shares, I know, but I don’t believe there are any people on earth who, properly sheltered, don’t feel the peace inside a summer rain and the cleansing it brings, the renewal of the earth in its aftermath."

33,Johnny Cash Quotes,It makes me so mad that some people underestimate the wisdom and energy of young people. All because they don’t look the way older folks think they should look. I’m working on a song about it. Maybe some of those closed minded people will realize long hair and tattoos don’t mean they should be ignored. Close minded people are part of what’s wrong with this world.
34,Johnny Cash Quotes,"I love the freedoms we got in this country, I appreciate your freedom to burn your flag if you want to, but I really appreciate my right to bear arms so I can shoot you if you try to burn mine."

37,Johnny Cash Quotes,"There’s unconditional love there. You hear that phrase a lot but it’s real with me and her [June Carter]. She loves me in spite of everything, in spite of myself.

We fell madly in love and we worked together all the time, toured together all the time, and when the tour was over we both had to go home to other people. It hurt."

43,Johnny Cash Quotes,"I’m not really concerned about boundaries. I just follow my conscience and my heart. Follow your heart. That’s what I do. Compassion is something I have a lot of, because I’ve been through a lot of pain in my life. Anybody who has suffered a lot of pain has a lot of compassion."
44,Johnny Cash Quotes,"Life and love go on, let the music play."
45,Johnny Cash Quotes,"The spirit of June Carter overshadows me tonight with the love she had for me and the love I have for her. We connect somewhere between here and Heaven.

I thank God for June Carter. I love her with all my heart."

62,Johnny Cash Quotes,"I wore black because I liked it. I still do, and wearing it still means something to me. It’s still my symbol of rebellion — against a stagnant status quo, against our hypocritical houses of God, against people whose minds are closed to others’ ideas."
63,Johnny Cash Quotes,"I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin’ in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he’s a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who never read."

1,Malcolm X Quotes,"What I want to know is how the white man, with the blood of black people dripping off his fingers, can have the audacity to be asking black people [why] they hate him?"
2,Malcolm X Quotes,"Yes, I’m an extremist. The black race… is in extremely bad condition. You show me a black man who isn’t an extremist and I’ll show you one who needs psychiatric attention!"
3,Malcolm X Quotes,"I find it difficult [to believe] that… Christians accuse [Black Muslims] of teaching racial supremacy or… hatred, because their own history and… teachings are filled with it."
4,Malcolm X Quotes,"Sitting at the table doesn’t make you a diner, unless you eat some of what’s on that plate. Being here in America doesn’t make you an American. Being born here in America doesn’t make you an American."
5,Malcolm X Quotes,"The holiest and most sacred city on earth. The fountain of truth, love, peace, and brotherhood."

9,Malcolm X Quotes,"We’re not Americans, we’re Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn’t land on Plymouth Rock – that rock landed on us."
10,Malcolm X Quotes,"It is a time for martyrs now, and if I am to be one, it will be for the cause of brotherhood. That’s the only thing that can save this country."

12,Malcolm X Quotes,People involved in a revolution don’t become part of the system; they destroy the system… The Negro revolution is no revolution because it condemns the system and then asks the system it has condemned to accept them…
13,Malcolm X Quotes,"One of the things that made the Black Muslim movement grow was its emphasis upon things African. This was the secret to the growth of the Black Muslim movement.

22,Malcolm X Quotes,"If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it is wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men, then it is wrong for America to draft us, and make us violent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for America to draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own people right here in this country."

24,Malcolm X Quotes,I am for violence if non-violence means we continue postponing a solution to the American black man’s problem just to avoid violence.

39,Malcolm X Quotes,"I want Dr. King to know that I didn’t come to Selma to make his job difficult. I really did come thinking I could make it easier. If the white people realize what the alternative is, perhaps they will be more willing to hear Dr. King."

42,Malcolm X Quotes,"I believe in the brotherhood of all men, but I don’t believe in wasting brotherhood on anyone who doesn’t want to practice it with me. Brotherhood is a two-way street."
43,Malcolm X Quotes,"It takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because you’re on your own. In conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up—planes over your head and all that kind of stuff. But a guerrilla is on his own. All you have is a rifle, some sneakers and a bowl of rice, and that’s all you need — and a lot of heart."
44,Malcolm X Quotes,"There is nothing in our book, the Koran, that teaches us to suffer peacefully. Our religion teaches us to be intelligent. Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. That’s a good religion."
45,Malcolm X Quotes,"When a person places the proper value on freedom, there is nothing under the sun that he will not do to acquire that freedom. Whenever you hear a man saying he wants freedom, but in the next breath he is going to tell you what he won’t do to get it, or what he doesn’t believe in doing in order to get it, he doesn’t believe in freedom. A man who believes in freedom will do anything under the sun to acquire or preserve his freedom."
46,Malcolm X Quotes,"They put your mind right in a bag, and take it wherever they want."
47,Malcolm X Quotes,You don’t have to be a man to fight for freedom. All you have to do is to be an intelligent human being.
48,Malcolm X Quotes,"The real names of our people were destroyed during slavery.

I never acknowledge it whatsoever."
49,Malcolm X Quotes,"I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won’t let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion."

54,Malcolm X Quotes,"The day that the black man takes an uncompromising step and realizes that he’s within his rights, when his own freedom is being jeopardized, to use any means necessary to bring about his freedom or put a halt to that injustice, I don’t think he’ll be by himself."

60,Malcolm X Quotes,"I feel like a man who has been asleep somewhat and under someone else’s control. I feel that what I’m thinking and saying is now for myself. Before it was for and by the guidance of Elijah Muhammad. Now I think with my own mind, sir!"
61,Malcolm X Quotes,To have once been a criminal is no disgrace. To remain a criminal is the disgrace.
62,Malcolm X Quotes,"I have more respect for a man who lets me know where he stands, even if he’s wrong, than the one who comes up like an angel and is nothing but a devil."
63,Malcolm X Quotes,You can’t hate the roots of a tree and not hate the tree. You can’t hate Africa and not hate yourself.
64,Malcolm X Quotes,"My black brothers and sisters – of all religious beliefs, or of no religious beliefs – we all have in common the greatest binding tie we could have. We are all black people!"
65,Malcolm X Quotes,Segregation is that which is forced upon an inferior by a superior. Separation is done voluntarily by two equals.
66,Malcolm X Quotes,I just don’t believe that when people are being unjustly oppressed that they should let someone else set rules for them by which they can come out from under that oppression.
67,Malcolm X Quotes,It’s hard for anyone intelligent to be nonviolent.
68,Malcolm X Quotes,"In the past, the greatest weapon the white man has had has been his ability to divide and conquer. If I take my hand and slap you, you don’t even feel it. It might sting you because these digits are separated. But all I have to do to put you back in your place is bring those digits together."
69,Malcolm X Quotes,"When we see that our problem is so complicated and so all-encompassing in its intent and content, then we realize that it is no longer a Negro problem, confined only to the American Negro; that it is no longer an American problem, confined only to America, but it is a problem for humanity."

71,Malcolm X Quotes,"If you turn the other cheek, you can be enslaved for 1,000 years."

74,Malcolm X Quotes,America is the first country that can actually have a bloodless revolution.
75,Malcolm X Quotes,Do you know what integration really means? It means intermarriage. That’s the real point behind it. You can’t have it without intermarriage. And that would result in disintegration of both races.
76,Malcolm X Quotes,Integration will not bring a man back from the grave.
77,Malcolm X Quotes,"I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and the root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems we face as a race.Martin Luther King, Jr."
78,Malcolm X Quotes,"The black student group I was in wrote him a letter saying we’d heard he’d suspended security provisions – people weren’t being searched fully like before. We told him we thought that was not wise, in fact more security should be in place. He wrote back, and after thanking us, said, ‘Brothers, our people are patted down and knocked down every day of their lives. We want them to come in here and know that they are among their brothers and sisters.’James Turner, Founding Director of African Studies at Cornell University"
79,Malcolm X Quotes,"I had just moved to Harlem. It was the first night I was there, and I went for a walk and there was a rally going on. Of course, I had heard about Malcolm before that, but it was mostly the kind of negative things they were running about him in the press then. I felt as if I was hearing the truth. I had never heard anyone speak with such clarity and forcefulness. And he just stimulated me. I found if he mentioned a book or a magazine article, I would try to find it. You hear people use that cliche about the University of the Streets. It really was that.A. Peter Bailey, Journalist"
80,Malcolm X Quotes,"Here – at this final hour, Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes – extinguished now, and gone from us forever.. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain – and we will smile. .We will answer and say unto them, ‘Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever really listen to him? .For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him.’Ossie Davis, Actor"
81,Malcolm X Quotes,"This was a brother you could believe. There was the sense that he was not in it for something. That was the extraordinary thing about him. He was in it because of his commitment to our liberation.James Turner, Founding Director of African Studies at Cornell University"

12,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Left-wing zealots have often been prepared to ride roughshod over due process and basic considerations of fairness when they think they can get away with it. For them the ends always seems to justify the means. That is precisely how their predecessors came to create the gulag.
13,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Of course, to be a mother and a housewife is a vocation of a very high kind. But I simply felt that it was not the whole of my vocation. I knew that I also wanted a career. A phrase that Irene Ward, MP for Tynemouth, and I often used was that ‘while the home must always be the centre of one’s life, it should not be the boundary of one’s ambitions’."
14,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"It may be the cock that crows, but it is the hen that lays the eggs."

54,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand ‘I have a problem, it is the Government’s job to cope with it!’ or ‘I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!’ ‘I am homeless, the Government must house me!’ and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first… There is no such thing as society. There is living tapestry of men and women and people and the beauty of that tapestry and the quality of our lives will depend upon how much each of us is prepared to take responsibility for ourselves and each of us prepared to turn round and help by our own efforts those who are unfortunate."
55,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"The choice facing the nation is between two totally different ways of life. And what a prize we have to fight for: no less than the chance to banish from our land the dark, divisive clouds of Marxist socialism and bring together men and women from all walks of life who share a belief in freedom."
56,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"I just owe almost everything to my father and it’s passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town, in a very modest home, are just the things that I believe have won the election."
57,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Whether it is in the United States or in mainland Europe, written constitutions have one great weakness. That is that they contain the potential to have judges take decisions which should properly be made by democratically elected politicians."
58,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Pennies do not come from heaven. They have to be earned here on earth.
59,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"The defence budget is one of the very few elements of public expenditure that can truly be described as essential. This point was well-made by a robust Labour Defence Minister, Denis (Now Lord) Healey, many years ago: ‘Once we have cut expenditure to the extent where our security is imperiled, we have no houses, we have no hospitals, we have no schools. We have a heap of cinders.’"
60,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"If… many influential people have failed to understand, or have just forgotten, what we were up against in the Cold War and how we overcame it, they are not going to be capable of securing, let alone enlarging, the gains that liberty has made."
61,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"…The larger the slice taken by government, the smaller the cake available for everyone."
62,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Nothing is more obstinate than a fashionable consensus.
63,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Whether manufactured by black, white, brown or yellow hands, a widget remains a widget – and it will be bought anywhere if the price and quality are right. The market is a more powerful and more reliable liberating force than government can ever be."
64,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"I am in politics because of the conflict between good and evil, and I believe that in the end good will triumph."
65,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,There can be no liberty unless there is economic liberty.
66,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,To be free is better than to be unfree – always. Any politician who suggests the opposite should be treated as suspect.
67,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"During my lifetime most of the problems the world has faced have come, in one fashion or other, from mainland Europe, and the solutions from outside it."
68,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,We Conservatives hate unemployment.
69,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,There is much to be said for trying to improve some disadvantaged people’s lot. There is nothing to be said for trying to create heaven on earth.
70,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,It is one of the great weaknesses of reasonable men and women that they imagine that projects which fly in the face of commonsense are not serious or being seriously undertaken.
71,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"To me, consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values and policies. So it is something in which no one believes and to which no one objects."
72,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,We were told our campaign wasn’t sufficiently slick. We regard that as a compliment.
73,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"…Conservatives have excellent credentials to speak about human rights. By our efforts, and with precious little help from self-styled liberals, we were largely responsible for securing liberty for a substantial share of the world’s population and defending it for most of the rest."
74,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,If my critics saw me walking over the Thames they would say it was because I couldn’t swim.
75,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Oh, but you know, you do not achieve anything without trouble, ever."
76,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Defeat? I do not recognize the meaning of the word.
77,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"To be successful you have to be selfish, or else you never achieve. And once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish. Stay reachable. Stay in touch. Don’t isolate."
78,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"We want a society where people are free to make choices, to make mistakes, to be generous and compassionate. This is what we mean by a moral society; not a society where the state is responsible for everything, and no one is responsible for the state."
79,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,I seem to smell the stench of appeasement in the air.
80,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"The woman’s mission is not to enhance the masculine spirit, but to express the feminine; hers is not to preserve a man-made world, but to create a human world by the infusion of the feminine element into all of its activities."
81,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Ought we not to ask the media to agree among themselves a voluntary code of conduct, under which they would not say or show anything which could assist the terrorists’ morale or their cause while the hijack lasted."
82,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,And what a prize we have to fight for: no less than the chance to banish from our land the dark divisive clouds of Marxist socialism.
83,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Democratic nations must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend.
84,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"One only gets to the top rung of the ladder by steadily climbing up one at a time, and suddenly all sorts of powers, all sorts of abilities which you thought never belonged to you–suddenly become within your own possibility and you think, Well, I’ll have a go, too."
85,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"If it is once again one against forty-eight, then I am very sorry for the forty-eight."
86,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,Most women defend themselves. It is the female of the species — it is the tigress and lioness in you — which tends to defend when attacked.
87,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,One of the things being in politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned or reasonable sex.
88,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,I shan’t be pulling the levers there but I shall be a very good back-seat driver.
89,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"The world has lost one of the great champions of freedom and liberty, and America has lost a true friend. As a grocer’s daughter who rose to become Britain’s first female prime minister, she stands as an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can’t be shattered. As prime minister, she helped restore the confidence and pride that has always been the hallmark of Britain at its best. And as an unapologetic supporter of our transatlantic alliance, she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the Cold War and extend freedom’s promise.Barack Obama "
90,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"She will be remembered not only for being Britain’s first female prime minister and holding the office for eleven years, but also for the determination and resilience with which she carried out all her duties throughout her public life. Even those who disagreed with her never doubted the strength of her convictions and her unwavering belief in Britain’s destiny in the world.Gordon Brown, Former Labour Prime Minister"
91,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"She was a wonderful, wonderful person. I believe that history will honour her for all that she achieved and it has been a great privilege to have been by her side for the past 35 years.Cynthia Crawford, Former PA to Baroness Thatcher"
92,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"She changed our country forever and all of us owe so much to her. A legacy few will ever equal.William Hague, Foreign Secretary"

94,Margaret Thatcher Quotes,"Margaret Thatcher was a truly formidable prime minister whose policies defined a political generation.Alex Salmond, Scottish First Minister"
0,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"In Hollywood a girl’s virtue is much less important than her hairdo. You’re judged by how you look, not by what you are. Hollywood’s a place where they’ll pay you a thousand dollars for kiss, and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty."
1,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I’m very definitely a woman and I enjoy it.
2,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Everybody is always tugging at you. They’d all like a sort of chunk out of you. I don’t think they realize it, but it’s like ‘grrr do this, grr do that…’But you do want to stay intact and on two feet."
3,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,A woman can’t be alone. She needs a man. A man and a woman support and strengthen each other. She just can’t do it by herself.
4,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I always felt insecure and in the way, but most of all I felt scared. I guess I wanted love more than anything else in the world."
5,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"If I’m a star, then the people made me a star."
6,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Creativity has got to start with humanity and when you’re a human being, you feel, you suffer."
7,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn’t that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you.
8,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Fame will go by and, so long, I’ve had you, Fame. If it goes by, I’ve always known it was fickle."
9,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,The most unsatisfactory men are those who pride themselves on their virility and regard sex as if it were some form of athletics at which you can win cups. It is a woman’s spirit and mood a man has to stimulate in order to make sex interesting. The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes or by just staring into space.
10,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"First, I’m trying to prove to myself that I’m a person. Then maybe I’ll convince myself that I’m an actress."
11,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"This life is what you make it. No matter what, you’re going to mess up sometimes, it’s a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you’re going to mess it up."
12,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"With fame, you know, you can read about yourself, somebody else’s ideas about you, but what’s important is how you feel about yourself – for survival and living day to day with what comes up."
13,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I want to grow old without facelifts… I want to have the courage to be loyal to the face I’ve made. Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you’d never complete your life, would you? You’d never wholly know you."
14,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Arthur Miller wouldn’t have married me if I had been nothing but a dumb blonde.
15,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl. All little girls should be told they’re pretty, even if they aren’t."
16,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated.
17,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Respect is one of life’s greatest treasures. I mean, what does it all add up to if you don’t have that?"
18,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I won’t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me. Of course, that doesn’t mean I want them to stop looking."
19,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I’m one of the world’s most self-conscious people. I really have to struggle.

22,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I think that sexuality is only attractive when it’s natural and spontaneous.
23,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"A man is more frank and sincere with his emotions than a woman. We girls, I’m afraid, have a tendency to hide our feelings."
24,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,My work is the only ground I’ve ever had to stand on. I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation but I’m working on the foundation.
25,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I’m one of the world’s most self-conscious people. I really have to struggle.
26,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I don’t consider myself an intellectual. And this is not one of my aims. But I admire intellectual people.
27,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I’m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they’ve made of me– and that I’ve made of myself– as a sex symbol. They expect bells to ring and whistles to whistle, but my anatomy is the same as any other woman’s and I can’t live up to it."
28,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"A wise girl kisses but doesn’t love, listens but doesn’t believe, and leaves before she is left."
29,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I don’t mind living in a man’s world, as long as I can be a woman in it."
30,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"If I play a stupid girl and ask a stupid question, I’ve got to follow it through, what am I supposed to do, look intelligent?"
31,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,It’s far better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone — so far.
32,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I don’t know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot!"
33,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Before marriage, a girl has to make love to a man to hold him. After marriage, she has to hold him to make love to him."
34,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,If you’re gonna be two-faced at least make one of them pretty.
35,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I’ve never fooled anyone. I’ve let people fool themselves. They didn’t bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn’t argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn’t.
36,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,It’s not true that I had nothing on. I had the radio on.
37,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I love to do the things the censors won’t pass.
38,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"When it comes down to it, I let them think what they want. If they care enough to bother with what I do, then I’m already better than them."

40,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else."
41,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,It’s often just enough to be with someone. I don’t need to touch them. Not even talk. A feeling passes between you both. You’re not alone.
42,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Dogs never bite me. Just humans.
43,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,In spite of everything life is not without hope.
44,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,A girl doesn’t need anyone that doesn’t need her.
45,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up."
46,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,All we demanded was our right to twinkle.
47,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I don’t mind being burdened with being glamorous and sexual. Beauty and femininity are ageless and can’t be contrived, and glamour, although the manufacturers won’t like this, cannot be manufactured. Not real glamour; it’s based on femininity."
48,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,All a girl really wants is for one guy to prove to her that they are not all the same.
49,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Ever notice how ‘What the hell’ is always the right answer?

58,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"It’s all make believe, isn’t it?"
59,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I read poetry to save time.
60,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,You might as well make yourself fly as to make yourself love.
61,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,That’s the way you feel when you’re beaten inside. You don’t feel angry at those who’ve beaten you. You just feel ashamed.
62,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Always remember to smile and look up at what you got in life.
63,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Looking back, I guess I used to play-act all the time. For one thing, it meant I could live in a more interesting world than the one around me."

67,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I am not a victim of emotional conflicts. I am human.
68,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn’t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one."
69,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Millions of people live their entire lives without finding themselves. But it is something I must do.

73,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Please quote me right!
74,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"The ‘public’ scares me, but people I trust."

76,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Anything’s possible, almost."
77,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"This is supposed to be an art form, not just a manufacturing establishment. The sensitivity that helps me to act, you see, also makes me react. An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument."
78,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I never wanted to be Marilyn — it just happened. Marilyn’s like a veil I wear over Norma Jeane.
79,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,Its not too much fun to know yourself too well or think you do — everyone needs a little conceit to carry them through and past the falls.
80,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,This is a free and democratic country and no one has a monopoly on anything.
81,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"For life: it is rather a determination not to be overwhelmed. For work: the truth can only be recalled, never invented."

84,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,It takes a smart brunette to play a dumb blonde.
85,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"Acting isn’t something you do. Instead of doing it, it occurs. If you’re going to start with logic, you might as well give up. You can have conscious preparation, but you have unconscious results."
86,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another — it shows an inner life. I like to see that there’s something going on inside them.
87,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"She’d come out of our apartment in a shleppy old coat, looking like my maid, and all the people would push her aside to get my autograph. She loved it.Shelley Winters"
88,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I was very, very drawn to her. To me, she was like a golden child. She radiated light and vulnerability. She used to gravitate to me at parties because she knew I was not very secure either. She was fragile. I was very touched by her.Jane Fonda"
89,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"She was trying to prove she was a serious actress and not just a movie star playing bimbo parts,” said Murray, who earned an Oscar nomination as Beau. “She was trying to prove she was an actress of substance, and in my opinion she certainly did.Don Murray"
90,Marilyn Monroe Quotes,"I never saw anybody work so hard, but it wasn’t an easy ride. She did such a good job and personally, I think she stole the whole damn show. I just think she was thrown into a nest of vipers.Mitzi Gaynor"
0,Mark Cuban Quotes,It doesn’t matter how many times you fail. You only have to be right once and then everyone can tell you that you are an overnight success.
1,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk – replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of – is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere."
2,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Don’t start a company unless it’s an obsession and something you love. If you have an exit strategy, it’s not an obsession."
3,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I’m a believer that you accomplish much, much more with direct relationships than by using an intermediary. And that cash you keep in the bank can be the difference between staying alive as a small business, or not."
4,Mark Cuban Quotes,"If you’ve got $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, you’re better off paying off any debt you have because that’s a guaranteed return."
5,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I wouldn’t be where I am now if I didn’t fail a lot. The good, the bad, it’s all part of the success equation."
6,Mark Cuban Quotes,What I’ve learned in these 11 years is you got to stay focused and believe in yourself and trust your own ability and judgment.
7,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Everyone is passionate about something. Usually more than one thing. We are born with it. There are always going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really, really want to do with our lives. Those passions aren’t worth a nickel."
8,Mark Cuban Quotes,It’s not whom you know. It’s not how much money you have. It’s very simple. It’s whether or not you have the edge and have the guts to use it.
9,Mark Cuban Quotes,Always ask yourself how someone could preempt your product or service.
10,Mark Cuban Quotes,Do we know what we are designed to be or do we find out through experience?
11,Mark Cuban Quotes,"With every effort, I learned a lot. With every mistake, I learned what not to do."
12,Mark Cuban Quotes,"The edge is knowing people think you’re crazy, and they’re right, but you don’t care what they think."
13,Mark Cuban Quotes,Everyday I look in the mirror and make sure I don’t pinch myself so I don’t wake up. I don’t take it for granted. All the time I say ‘Why me?’
14,Mark Cuban Quotes,It’s always better if you’re honest with yourself and anticipate where the problems could come from.
15,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I had to kick myself in the ass and recommit to getting up early, staying up late and consuming anything I possibly could to get an edge."
16,Mark Cuban Quotes,Relaxing is for the other guy.
17,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Wherever I see people doing something the way it’s always been done, the way it’s ‘supposed’ to be done, following the same old trends, well, that’s just a big red flag to me to go look somewhere else."
18,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I still work hard to know my business. I’m continuously looking for ways to improve all my companies, and I’m always selling. Always."
19,Mark Cuban Quotes,I worked hard and smarter than most people in the businesses I have been in.
20,Mark Cuban Quotes,Always wake up with a smile knowing that today you are going to have fun accomplishing what others are too afraid to do.
21,Mark Cuban Quotes,Because if you’re prepared and you know what it takes. It’s not a risk. You just have to figure out how to get there. There is always a way to get there.
22,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Learn to sell. In business you’re always selling – to your prospects, investors and employees. To be the best salesperson put yourself in the shoes of the person to whom you are selling. Don’t sell your product. Solve their problem."
23,Mark Cuban Quotes,"If you have managers reporting to managers in a startup, you will fail. Once you get beyond startup, if you have managers reporting to managers, you will create politics."
24,Mark Cuban Quotes,Pay attention to what’s happening around you. Don’t think there’s just one way to do things—context is everything.
25,Mark Cuban Quotes,One of the most underrated skills in business right now is being nice.
26,Mark Cuban Quotes,"In every business I have had, I have made sure my customers have had my email address and can reach me directly."
27,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Great entrepreneurs invest the time, no matter how many hours a day, to learn more about their industry and the business they want to start than anyone else."
28,Mark Cuban Quotes,What is your grind?
29,Mark Cuban Quotes,"It’s not about money or connections, it’s the willingness to outwork and outlearn everyone when it comes to your business. And if it fails, you learn from what happened and do a better job next time."
30,Mark Cuban Quotes,"What I do know, at least what I think I have learned from my experiences in business, is that when there is a rush for everyone to do the same thing, it becomes more difficult to do. Not easier. Harder."
31,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Being rich is a good thing. Not just in the obvious sense of benefiting you and your family, but in the broader sense. Profits are not a zero sum game. The more you make, the more of a financial impact you can have."
32,Mark Cuban Quotes,"The one person who you should never believe when it comes to evaluating your abilities is you. The very worst judge of your abilities is you. Self-evaluation is never successful. When you are the best at something, the demand for your services will grow. People want to hire the best. They want to be associated with the best."
33,Mark Cuban Quotes,"In my opinion, right now, there’s way too much hype on the technologies and not enough attention to the real businesses behind them."
34,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Your biggest enemies are your bills. The more you owe, the more you stress. The more you stress over bills, the more difficult it is to focus on your goals. More importantly, if you set your monthly income requirements too high, you eliminate a significant number of opportunities. The cheaper you can live, the greater your options."
35,Mark Cuban Quotes,"If you’re looking where everybody else is looking, you’re looking in the wrong spot."
36,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Once you have found out what you love to do, there is only one goal: How can you be the best in the world at it. It doesn’t matter if you are a filing clerk, athlete, accountant, or bartender. All that matters is that you do whatever you can to be the best."
37,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Focus on building the best possible business. If you are great, people will notice and opportunities will appear."
38,Mark Cuban Quotes,Sweat equity is the most valuable equity there is. Know your business and industry better than anyone else in the world. Love what you do or don’t do it.
39,Mark Cuban Quotes,Entrepreneurs have to be brutally honest with themselves and recognize where they have added value and where they have gone along for the ride.
40,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I retired at twenty-nine, bought a life-time pass on American Airlines and my only goal in life was to party like a mad man and get drunk with as many people as possible. And I was happy right there. But when we started the streaming business, I knew it could be something big."
41,Mark Cuban Quotes,You have to learn how to use time wisely and be productive. How wisely you use your time will have far more impact on your life and success than any amount of money.
42,Mark Cuban Quotes,Those back-to-back experiences confirmed what I already knew: That I was a shitty-ass employee and I’d better start my own business.
43,Mark Cuban Quotes,"Patent law holds us back, in every which way, shape or form. There is place for it, in physical products, in pharmaceuticals, but in software in particular, there is no place for it."
44,Mark Cuban Quotes,"You learn in life that a lot of things are the result of effort, but some things, in terms of scale, are random."
45,Mark Cuban Quotes,We don’t sell wins or losses. The one thing you can’t control in sports is which games you are going to win or which games you are going to lose. But what I could control was the experience the fans have.
46,Mark Cuban Quotes,I want the bad news first.
47,Mark Cuban Quotes,One thing we can all control is effort. Put in the time to become an expert in whatever you’re doing. It will give you an advantage because most people don’t do this.
48,Mark Cuban Quotes,I’m always afraid of failing. It’s great motivation to work harder.
49,Mark Cuban Quotes,It’s hard not to fool yourself. Everyone tells you how they are going to be special. But few do the work to get there. Do the work.
50,Mark Cuban Quotes,Creating opportunities means looking where others are not.
51,Mark Cuban Quotes,Life gets easier when you don’t have to worry about the bills.
52,Mark Cuban Quotes,It’s called working your ass off.
53,Mark Cuban Quotes,"I’m a big believer that you always reiterate, you always learn, you always realize your business is evolving."
54,Mark Cuban Quotes,"When you’ve got 10,000 people trying to do the same thing, why would you want to be number 10,001?"
55,Mark Cuban Quotes,The number-one job of the hedge-fund manager is not to make sure that you can retire with a smile on your face – it’s for him to retire with a smile on his face.
56,Mark Cuban Quotes,"A sure sign of failure for a startup is when someone sends me logo-embroidered polo shirts. If your people are at shows and in public, it’s okay to buy for your own employees, but if you really think people are going to wear your branded polo when they’re out and about, you are mistaken and have no idea how to spend your money."
57,Mark Cuban Quotes,I create offbeat advice; I don’t follow it. I rarely take third-party advice on my investments.
58,Mark Cuban Quotes,"It is so much easier to be nice, to be respectful, to put yourself in your customers’ shoes and try to understand how you might help them before they ask for help, than it is to try to mend a broken customer relationship."

We can very well set a mood of peace out of which a system of peace can be built."
83,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.

87,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline.

93,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"Courage is an inner resolution to go forward despite obstacles; Cowardice is submissive surrender to circumstances. Courage breeds creativity; Cowardice represses fear and is mastered by it. Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expediency asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? But conscience ask the question, is it right? And there comes a time when we must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right."
94,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"By opening our lives to God in Christ, we become new creatures. This experience, which Jesus spoke of as the new birth, is essential if we are to be transformed nonconformists … Only through an inner spiritual transformation do we gain the strength to fight vigorously the evils of the world in a humble and loving spirit."
95,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"Now there is a final reason I think that Jesus says, ‘Love your enemies.’ It is this: that love has within it a redemptive power. And there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals. Just keep being friendly to that person. Just keep loving them, and they can’t stand it too long. Oh, they react in many ways in the beginning. They react with guilt feelings, and sometimes they’ll hate you a little more at that transition period, but just keep loving them. And by the power of your love they will break down under the load. That’s love, you see. It is redemptive, and this is why Jesus says love. There’s something about love that builds up and is creative. There is something about hate that tears down and is destructive. So love your enemies."
96,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,The God whom we worship is not a weak and incompetent God. He is able to beat back gigantic waves of opposition and to bring low prodigious mountains of evil. The ringing testimony of the Christian faith is that God is able.

101,Martin Luther King Jr. Quotes,"We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization – black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King Jr. did, to understand and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion and love…. What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.Robert F.

33,Walt Disney Quotes,"Children are people, and they should have to reach to learn about things, to understand things, just as adults have to reach if they want to grow in mental stature."
34,Walt Disney Quotes,"Childishness? I think it’s the equivalent of never losing your sense of humor. I mean, there’s a certain something that you retain. It’s the equivalent of not getting so stuffy that you can’t laugh at others."
35,Walt Disney Quotes,"I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the child in all of us, whether he be six or sixty. Call the child innocence."
36,Walt Disney Quotes,"I don’t believe in playing down to children, either in life or in motion pictures. I didn’t treat my own youngsters like fragile flowers, and I think no parent should."
37,Walt Disney Quotes,I have long felt that the way to keep children out of trouble is to keep them interested in things.
38,Walt Disney Quotes,"Why do we have to grow up? I know more adults who have the children’s approach to life. They’re people who don’t give a hang what the Jones’ do. You see them at Disneyland every time you go there. They are not afraid to be delighted with simple pleasures, and they have a degree of contentment with what life has brought – sometimes it isn’t much, either."
39,Walt Disney Quotes,"You’re dead if you aim only for kids. Adults are only kids grown up, anyway."
40,Walt Disney Quotes,"Every child is born blessed with a vivid imagination. But just as a muscle grows flabby with disuse, so the bright imagination of a child pales in later years if he ceases to exercise it."
41,Walt Disney Quotes,It’s a mistake not to give people a chance to learn to depend on themselves while they are young.
42,Walt Disney Quotes,Animation offers a medium of story telling and visual entertainment which can bring pleasure and information to people of all ages everywhere in the world.
43,Walt Disney Quotes,Animation is different from other parts. Its language is the language of caricature. Our most difficult job was to develop the cartoon’s unnatural but seemingly natural anatomy for humans and animals.
44,Walt Disney Quotes,Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive. This facility makes it the most versatile and explicit means of communication yet devised for quick mass appreciation.
45,Walt Disney Quotes,"In our animation we must show only the actions and reactions of a character, but we must picture also with the action. . . the feeling of those characters."
46,Walt Disney Quotes,I try to build a full personality for each of our cartoon characters – to make them personalities.
47,Walt Disney Quotes,"I think a good study of music would be indispensable to the animators — a realization on their part of how primitive music is, how natural it is for people to want to go to music — a study of rhythm, the dance — the various rhythms enter into our lives every day."
48,Walt Disney Quotes,"I think you have to know these fellows definitely before you can draw them. When you start to caricature a person,you can’t do it without knowing the person. Take Laurel and Hardy for example; everybody can see Laurel doing certain things because they know Laurel."
49,Walt Disney Quotes,"Of all of our inventions for mass communication, pictures still speak the most universally understood language."
50,Walt Disney Quotes,I love Mickey Mouse more than any woman I have ever known.
51,Walt Disney Quotes,"When people laugh at Mickey Mouse, it’s because he’s so human; and that is the secret of his popularity."
52,Walt Disney Quotes,Mickey Mouse popped out of my mind onto a drawing pad 20 years ago on a train ride from Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at lowest ebb and disaster seemed right around the corner.
53,Walt Disney Quotes,I only hope that we don’t lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse.
54,Walt Disney Quotes,Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.
55,Walt Disney Quotes,I don’t want the public to see the world they live in while they’re in the Park (Disneyland). I want to feel they’re in another world.
56,Walt Disney Quotes,Disneyland is a work of love. We didn’t go into Disneyland just with the idea of making money.
57,Walt Disney Quotes,"We did it Disneyland, in the knowledge that most of the people I talked to thought it would be a financial disaster – closed and forgotten within the first year."
58,Walt Disney Quotes,Disneyland is a show.
59,Walt Disney Quotes,"I could never convince the financiers that Disneyland was feasible, because dreams offer too little collateral."
60,Walt Disney Quotes,"You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful place in the world, but it requires people to make the dream a reality."

64,Walt Disney Quotes,"We have created characters and animated them in the dimension of depth, revealing through them to our perturbed world that the things we have in common far outnumber and outweigh those that divide us."
65,Walt Disney Quotes,"At first the cartoon medium was just a novelty, but it never really began to hit until we had more than tricks… until we developed personalities. We had to get beyond getting a laugh. They may roll in the aisles, but that doesn’t mean you have a great picture. You have pathos in the thing."
66,Walt Disney Quotes,I take great pride in the artistic development of cartoons. Our characters are made to go through emotions.
67,Walt Disney Quotes,"I wanted to retain my individuality. I was afraid of being hampered by studio policies. I knew if someone else got control, I would be restrained."
68,Walt Disney Quotes,My greatest reward is that I have been able to build this wonderful organization.
69,Walt Disney Quotes,I would rather entertain and hope that people learned something than educate people and hope they were entertained.
70,Walt Disney Quotes,"I never called my work an ‘art’. It’s part of show business, the business of building entertainment."
71,Walt Disney Quotes,I believe in being a motivator.
72,Walt Disney Quotes,"I am interested in entertaining people, in bringing pleasure, particularly laughter, to others, rather than being concerned with ‘expressing’ myself with obscure creative impressions."
73,Walt Disney Quotes,I am not influenced by the techniques or fashions of any other motion picture company.
74,Walt Disney Quotes,"I am corny, you know? But I think there are just about 140 million people in this country who are just as corny as I am."
75,Walt Disney Quotes,"I am in no sense of the word a great artist, not even a great animator; I have always had men working for me whose skills were greater than my own. I am an idea man."
76,Walt Disney Quotes,"When I was a kid, a book I read advised young artists to be themselves. That decided it for me. I was a corny kind of guy, so I went in for corn."
77,Walt Disney Quotes,I don’t make pictures just to make money. I make money to make more pictures.

81,Walt Disney Quotes,"I dream, I test my dreams against my beliefs, I dare to take risks, and I execute my vision to make those dreams come true."
82,Walt Disney Quotes,"Of all the things I’ve done, the most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal."
83,Walt Disney Quotes,"I don’t like formal gardens. I like wild nature. It’s just the wilderness instinct in me, I guess."
84,Walt Disney Quotes,"I do not like to repeat successes, I like to go on to other things."
85,Walt Disney Quotes,I’d say it’s been my biggest problem all my life… it’s money. It takes a lot of money to make these dreams come true.
86,Walt Disney Quotes,"I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities, or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous."
